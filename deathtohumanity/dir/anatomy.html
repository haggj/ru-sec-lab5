<h1>Human anatomy</h1>
<p>Human anatomy is a relatively simple field. They mostly only have one, or a single pair of each organ. As a result of this simple anatomy their ability is severely limited. Humans cannot for example
see sounds, smell color, or communicate with animals of <strong>any</strong> kind. Their brain structure is also primitive, consisting most often of 2 lobes, that may or may not be connected to each other.
For this reason, humans are exceptionally dumb, being unable to visualize higher than the fifth dimension, achieve space flight or exit vim.</p>

<p>Their bodies usually contain a pair of organs, with the notable exception of the brain, and heart. This is why humans can most often survive with only 1 stomach or eye. They are however extremely susceptible to infection, thus we reccomend wiping your surgical equipment between uses. Sharpening your scalpels and scoopers should be done at least once a year.</p>

<p>If you are going to perform experiments on humans, it is advisable to source your humans from a different town than where you are situated to minimise the chance of discovery. If discovered, just blame another alien, which seems to work exceptionally well. The humans seem to assume that there is some sort of honor code between aliens, and that <em>"Aliens don't snitch on other aliens"</em>, laughable as that is it enables us to do kinda whatever we want and blame it on the Mi-Go.
