    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

    <p>There is nothing off about this web page. It is completely normal, and non-threatening.</p>
    <p>You might think <em>"This is exactly what someone who is trying to hide something would say"</em> and yes! you are right. But not now, I am completely, not hiding anything and there is,
    like, nothing peculiar about this site. It's just a blog about the hobbies me and my grandfather shared, some recipes, and information for my family on how to care for my special needs brother.</p>
    <p>Here is a link to <a href="blog.php">my non-threatening blog</a>, it's just so normal that you don't even have to look, you'd probably think it's boring, and wish that you just went and looked at facebook, or tumbler
    or twitter or that other one with the pictures.</p>
    <p>So, in closing, there is nothing interesting about this site, however if you happen to have in your posession the complete version of the necronomicon, would you mind terribly scanning in page 751
    and sending it to 13. Barrow rd. Dunwich Massachusetts, you'd be doing this world a great favor, I promise you.</p>
