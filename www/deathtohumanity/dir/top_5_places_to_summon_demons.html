<h1>Top 5 places to go to and summon demons </h1> 

<h2>1. R'lyeh</h2>
<p>The prime spot for summoning on all of earth. Exceptional reception and the intense pressures of the deep are sure to massage all the stiffness that comes from emulating human behaviors away. Only downside is that it requires over a 1000 hours of planning and travel. </p>

<h2>2. Hollywood, CA</h2>
<p>Due to still unknown reasons, dark energy is abound there. You can perform virtually any dark ritual there using only the existing energy as fuel, no sacrifices needed! Unfortunately, the cost of food, lodging and travel there makes it unfeasible as a summoning destination. They even charge rent for living in cardboard boxes.</p>

<h2>3. The city on the north pole</h2>
<p>Pristine mountains and fresh air makes this a very comfortable winter wonderland destination for the average summoner. The only problem is that the travel is difficult, and you need to bring your own sacrifices as nothing lives there except for the Shoggoths. And their lives are incompatible with most summoning rituals.</p>

<h2>4. Reykjavik University</h2>
<p>Generations of students have left enough resudual anxiety, desperation and prayer to last a very long time. The location also has convenient tunnels that are often cleaned. The only downside is that the demons summoned there are usually hijacked and used as TA's for various courses in the computer science department.</p>

<h2>5. Devil Reef</h2>
<p>Located a short distance from the harbor of Innsmouth, Massachusetts, the reef is really just a small outcropping of volcanic rock, the properties of which makes it ideal for calling forth demons of various origin. The only issue is that the location is infested with fish people, which will attempt to disrupt your operations. The only lodging there is the Gillman inn, which is terrible, do not reccomend. </p>
