<h1> How to pass as human </h1>

<p>After attending an online acting class, I beleive I can successfully pass as a human. They have this thing called method acting. Only problem is that I am not sure if it is worse to be outed as a method actor or as a world-destroying alien-human hybrid. At least some people agree that the earth and humanity must be destroyed. </p>

<h2> Walk correctly </h2>
<p>Since humans have an awkward, weirdly symmetrical anatomy, they walk like complete clowns. Mirroring their shambling gait puts other humans at ease but it is by no means the only step required to go unnoticed amongst humans</p>

<h2> Clothing </h2> 
<p> In the vast majority of cases, humans wear fabric over their bodies they call clothing. You should emulate this, as normal humans even get attention from others if they do not follow this social norm </p>

<h2> Social camouflage </h2>
<p> When it comes to moving amongst humans without being detected there is only one way that ensures that you become completely invisible and it is quite non-intuitive.
To move from place A to place B undetected, all you need to do is approach every human being you see and utter the phrase <em>"Can I interest you in the incredible healing power of essential oils"</em>. This seems to completely turn off the short term memory of most humans.
There are those that will still see you and even become very interested in you, but you do not need to worry too much about them, as the vast majority of humans will ignore them as they ignore you </p>
