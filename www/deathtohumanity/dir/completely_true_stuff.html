<h3>How to summon a lesser demon</h3>
<p>Draw a perfect circle on the ground, place in the perfect center a leather skin, then follow the instructions on page 400 of the necronomicon. In 3 days a lesser demon should materialise and follow your bidding for 3 hours, after which it will violently explode. Due to this being a lesser demon, it is not particularly useful only being able to lift about a kilogram. Personally, I use it for the purpose of passing butter, but do not forget to remove it from the dinner table before the 3 hours expire.</p> 

<h3>How to summon the ghost of a deceased person</h3>
<p>Draw a perfect circle on the ground, place in the perfectcenter an urn with a body part of the deceased. Follow the instructions on page 402 of the necronomicon, and the deceased persons spirit will be bound to the urn. Be careful not to break the urn, since this will release the spirit which will most likely haunt its family, possibly alerting them of what you are doing. Being a ghost, this is not particularly useful. The returned can not carry things, or effect the material world in any way. One future application is using these spirits as free labor in call centres when we can figure out how to allow them to answer a phone</p>
